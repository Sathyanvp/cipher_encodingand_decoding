 GeneralShift Cipher is simple substitution ciphers. 
 
 A simple substitution cipher is a cryptographic system in which letters (or their codes), are arbitrarily transposed or replaced with other letters (or their codes).
 
 Cryptograms that sometimes appear as newspaper puzzles are also simple substitution ciphers. Each letter is replaced by another letter

 
Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool
This Python application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is "shifted" a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encrypt Messages: Convert plain text messages into encrypted messages using a specified shift value.
Decrypt Messages: Convert encrypted messages back to plain text using the same shift value.
Flexible Shift Values: Users can specify any integer shift value to determine how far to shift the letters in the alphabet.
User-Friendly: Interactive prompts guide users through the encryption and decryption process.
How to Use
Run the Application: Execute the Python script.

Select Operation:

Type encode to encrypt a message, or decode to decrypt a message.
Input your Message:

Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt in lowercase.
Specify Shift Value:

Enter the numeric shift value (an integer).
Repeat: You will be prompted to perform another operation. Type yes to continue or no to exit.

Example
 
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
3
Encrypted message: khoor
 
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
decode
Type your message:
khoor
Type the shift number:
3
Decrypted message: hello
Implementation Details
The application is constructed using the core principles of Python programming.
It utilizes lists to handle the alphabet and string concatenation to build encrypted and decrypted outputs.
It handles cases where the shift value exceeds the alphabet length by wrapping around.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Standard Python libraries (no external libraries required)
Notes
The input message should only contain lowercase alphabetic characters.
You can choose any shift value, but keep in mind that a larger shift value leads to the same result as a smaller one when reduced modulo 26.
